# 🔐 CryptoLab - Practice Phase

This repository marks the **starting point** of my cryptography learning journey using Python.

Currently, it contains a collection of **practice scripts** that explore:
- File hashing
- AES encryption/decryption
- RSA key-based encryption
- Password hashing and verification

> 🧩 These scripts are part of my ongoing learning.  
> The project will evolve into a structured application as I progress further.
